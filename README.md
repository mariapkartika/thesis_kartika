# Maternal Health Thesis Project

This repository contains the analysis scripts, and visual outputs for my master's thesis on maternal health service utilization in Papua, Indonesia. 
The research examines key barriers and enablers along the continuum of care — from antenatal care (ANC) to delivery and postnatal care (PNC).

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Cleaned datasets used in the analysis.
- `scripts/`: R and RMarkdown scripts for modeling and visualization.
- `outputs/`: Visuals and reports generated from the analysis.
- `figures/`: Forest plots and other visual outputs.
- `thesis_kartika.Rproj`: RStudio project file.

##  Main Analyses
- ANC utilization and associated sociodemographic factors
- Delivery decision modeling (cost, distance, parity)
- PNC service gaps and forest plot visualization

## Tools Used
- R (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, broom, etc.)
- RMarkdown for documentation and reproducibility
